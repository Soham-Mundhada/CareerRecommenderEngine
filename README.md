### Process Flow:
![Flow of control]()


### Expected Features:
To cater to the increasing needs of young career aspirants, we propose “CARE” (Career Analysis and Recommendation Engine), a web-based platform where users will be asked to input their details like interests, hobbies, achievements, extracurricular activities, participation etc., which will be followed by answering a dynamic questionnaire in which the next question depends on the responses given by the user in the previous questions, by applying a funneling approach to funnel out(narrow down) the irrelevant and unnecessary collection of information from the user. Our AI model will then give a list of recommended career options that shall serve as a set of suggestions for the user to choose from, along with a personalized career path or roadmap to proceed with realizing those career options; a complete description of the journey to achieve the recommendations.
We also propose to add many additional features in our solution to make it more purposeful and a one-stop solution for the students of this country to cater to most of their needs during the career selection phase of their lives. These solutions include: 
<br/>
- Feasibility Prediction Model would predict the percentage feasibility to pursue a certain career option based on various factors such as family support, financial condition, skills etc.
<br/>
- Create an online shareable career profile for each user which will serve as a showcase resume which he/she can update from time to time as his interests and achievements alter.
<br/>
- We will build a chatbot (CAREbot) and integrate it into our system. The users can ask general FAQs and doubts to CAREbot and will get an instantaneous response to their queries.
<br/>
- Suitable institution options recommendations and prediction based on previous year cutoffs of entrance exams.
<br/>
- Job application listings portal to cater to the Training and Placement departments of colleges for on-campus recruitments.
<br/>
- Provision of the details and whereabouts of the recommended jobs like average salary, number of jobs in that field, soft skills required, daily tasks in that profession etc.
<br/>
The questionnaire will be a dynamic questionnaire in which the next question depends on the responses given by the user in the previous questions, by applying a funneling approach to funnel out (narrow down) the irrelevant and unnecessary collection of information from the user.
<br/> 
- A downloadable detailed statistical report of the personality and mental analysis of the user.
<br/>
- Creation of a national database where all the achievements and interests of citizens will be stored and further serve as a resource to analyze the population.
<br/>
- Predict the number of educational institutions and jobs that shall be created and need to be created in the future.
<br/>
- Percentage wise recommendation and labelling of different career options from best to less favourable.
<br/>
- Recommendation of career categories like academic, vocational, extra-curricular or entrepreneurship inclination.
<br/>
- There would also be a career explore section where users will be able to browse the various careers and get to know the details about each like average salary, working hours, work environment, skills required, daily work routine, job requirement etc.
<br/>
- The user can opt out of the details input process at any point of time as per his convenience. The model will give results as per the data collected from the user until that point in time.
<br/>
- We will also recommend a list of courses (which would be related to their recommended career domain) that the users can opt for to enhance their skills.
